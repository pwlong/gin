/* PWL this is where we should write the drivers
 * according to Roy's Project 2 specification we need functions to:
 *		Initialize the peripheral to the correct mode (we probably don't need this)
 *		Capture a frequency reading
 *		Convert count reading to scaled voltage
 *			corresponding to the average voltage
 *			applied to the LED
 * 		Adjust scaling factors based on actual operation
 * 			of our circuit (characterize the circuit)
